This is the installer for the Technology Private Eyes Monitoring Service.  These scripts will log the SMART status of the supported drives, as well as the RAID status of any Apple RAID or Apple Hardware RAID setups.  This also queries the system log and possibly Time Machine backups.  These are then compressed, archived and e-mailed.

This is still in testing.

Please Note:

1.  Change the notification e-mail in each script in /Library/Scripts/trmacs.
